# Sand Simulator

This is a little python sandbox game where players can experiment with fun and interactive sand physics!

## How It Works

- Uses the pygame graphics library
- Represented as a 2d grid of cells

## Features 

- Various grain types:
  - (new) Playable character
  - NPCs
  - Sand
  - Water
  - Stone
  - Grass
  - Void

## Skills I Learned from this Project

- Class inheritance
- Reference handling
- Modular Design
- Algorithmic Thinking
- Project Management

## Planned Changes

I hope to add a more features and cell types to this projet, potentially:
- More depth and complexity to NPC behavior
- Objectives and scoring
- Lava
- Water Source
- Terraforming
- Weather

I also plan on optimizing and debugging:
- abstraction
- Bound errors
- Optimizing behavior and algorithms
- Cleaning and organizing
